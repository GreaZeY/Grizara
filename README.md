Libraries/technologies used in Back-end

- `Express` : To create an API and its endpoint to fetch data in front-end.
- `MongoDB` : I am using Mongo database to store all products and users details.
- `Jsonwebtoken` : To create a web token to keep the user login without storing the actual username and password in cookie to my site because the token generated by this is digitally signed and owner of it can be verified.

- `stripe` : for accepting payment from the customer of product purchased.
- `nodemailer` : to send the email notification to user about purchase, order, delivery status and reset password link.
